Task instructions
Introduction

In this task, you will focus on developing a robust machine learning model to predict customer churn. Your objective is to select an appropriate algorithm, train and validate the model, and propose evaluation metrics that will help assess its performance. This task is pivotal for providing actionable insights that can inform business strategies at Lloyds Banking Group.

Instructions

Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm:

Review the characteristics of the data set and the nature of the churn prediction problem.
Consider algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, or neural networks.
Choose an algorithm that balances accuracy and interpretability, suitable for the business context.
Build and train the model:

Use the preprocessed data set from Task 1 to train your chosen model.
Implement techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalises well to unseen data.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimise the modelâ€™s performance.
Evaluate model performance:

Select appropriate metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix analysis.
Consider the implications of each metric in the context of imbalanced data sets, ensuring that the evaluation provides a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness.
Suggest ways to improve and utilise the model:

Provide recommendations on how the model can be used by the business to identify at-risk customers and develop retention strategies.
Discuss any potential improvements or adjustments to the model that could enhance its accuracy or applicability in different business scenarios.
Deliverable:

Report submission: Compile a comprehensive report that includes:
A detailed description of the selected algorithm and the rationale behind its choice.
The trained model, along with performance metrics and evaluation results.
Suggested ways to utilise the model's predictions for business decision-making and potential areas for improvement.
Ensure that your report is clear, concise, and well-organised, effectively communicating both the technical aspects of the model and its practical applications for the business. This report will be a critical tool for stakeholders to understand and leverage the predictive insights generated by your model.
